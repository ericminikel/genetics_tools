### Genetics tools

Right now this is a collection of one-off scripts related to designing CRISPR guide RNAs and then primers to amplify the cut sites. My ambition is to eventually make an all-in-one Python script that will take a list of genes and will design guide RNAs and primers and spit it all out in one file.

Relevant resources for python:
